The speaker covers the definition of machine learning (learning from data to make predictions), its various applications (speech recognition, web search, recommendation systems, computer vision, fraud detection, etc.), and the three main types: supervised (data is labeled), unsupervised (data is unlabeled), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error with rewards and penalties).  The video also details the steps in building a machine learning model, including data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, encoding, feature selection), algorithm selection (choosing appropriate algorithms for classification or regression), model building, and model evaluation.
