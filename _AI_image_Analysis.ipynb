As you can see from the picture, I've whipped up two gorgeous containers of teriyaki chicken and veggies.  Each one is a perfect balance of fluffy white rice, tender chunks of teriyaki chicken, vibrant orange and red bell peppers, and healthy servings of broccoli. It's colorful, itâ€™s delicious, and itâ€™s the perfect fuel for a busy week!\n> \n> \n> My journey with meal prepping hasnâ€™t always been smooth sailing.  Initially, I struggled to find recipes that were both healthy and tasted amazing. There were definitely a few culinary mishaps along the way (let's just say some experiments were... less successful than others!).  But I persevered, learning to balance flavors and experiment with different cooking techniques.\n> \n> \n> The key to my success has been finding simple, adaptable recipes. This teriyaki chicken recipe, for example, is incredibly versatile; I can easily swap out the vegetables based on whatâ€™s fresh at the market that week. The biggest win has been the time saved - prepping these meals on a Sunday means stress-free lunches and dinners for the rest of the week.  Plus, it makes sticking to a healthy diet so much easier!\n> \n> \n> So, if you're just starting your own meal prep journey, don't be discouraged by initial challenges. Embrace the experimentation, discover your favorite recipes, and most importantly, enjoy the process of creating delicious and healthy meals for yourself!  Happy cooking!\n"
